# PowerBI-Projects
This repository contains the list of all the completed PowerBi Projects. PowerBI is a powerful data intelligence tool that helps Data Analysts to create visuals and derive insights from the data.

## Sales Insights Project
Atliq Hardware is an Indian Technology company that has observed a drop in sales numbers. The Managing Director has asked for a detailed report. We created a detailed report consisting of revenue trend for last few years with highlighting top regions contributing to revenue and sales. Our report showcases top 5 customers in terms of revenue and sales. This report helps the stakeholders understand where we performing well and where we need to focus more.

## Customer Churn Prediction
Customer Churn Project analyses the behaviour of people and predicts which customers are likely to churn. The data set includes information about:
- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.

In PowerBI, we create visuals to understand relation between different variables to understand their correlation leading to customer churn. The visuals gives us insights into customer behaviour which can be helpful for companies to reduce customer churn percentage.
