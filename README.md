# PowerBI-Projects
This repository contains the list of all the completed PowerBi Projects. PowerBI is a powerful data intelligence tool that helps Data Analysts to create visuals and derive insights from the data.

## Super Bowl Commercial Analysis
We perform a Super Bowl Commercial Ads analysis for an upcoming US-based car manufacturer brand. The brand is looking to make an impact in the market by launching commercials. The report is created in Power BI Desktop to generate insights based on given Ads data from 2000 to 2021. Keeping in mind the creative direction requirement of the client, we try to understand the impact of Ad lengths on viewers. The report helps us find popular Ad elements like Fun content or product-related content. Here we focus on the data of other competitive automotive brands that have run ads in past on TV and YouTube.

## Zomato Restaurant Dashboard
Zomato is a popular food delivery brand growing in stature every day. Zomato has listed restaurants that serve delicious cuisine to customers. We built a dashbaord for restaurants listed on Zomato in multiple countries. Our report consists of details such as location of the restaurants, ratings, popularity, average cost for two and online delivery availability. The report follows the brand color code and keeps the visuals simple to gain maximum insights.  

## Sales Insights Project
Atliq Hardware is an Indian Technology company that has observed a drop in sales numbers. The Managing Director has asked for a detailed report. We created a detailed report consisting of revenue trend for last few years with highlighting top regions contributing to revenue and sales. Our report showcases top 5 customers in terms of revenue and sales. This report helps the stakeholders understand well performing areas and segemnts that need more attention.

## Customer Churn Prediction
Customer Churn Project analyses the behaviour of people and predicts which customers are likely to churn. The data set includes information about:
- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.

In PowerBI, we create visuals to understand relation between different variables to understand their correlation leading to customer churn. The visuals gives us insights into customer behaviour which can be helpful for companies to reduce customer churn percentage.
